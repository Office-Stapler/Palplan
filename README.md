# Palplan

## Overview
Palplan is a gamified habit and productivity tracker that helps users maintain their goals in a fun and easy way.

Planner is split into two sections, a “habit” section and a “scheduled habit ” section, the habit section is a simple checklist where users can just mark each habit as done for the day.
The scheduled habit section will be a habit that the app will directly help track, i.e “starting” an activity.
When users “start” their desired activity a live timer will be displayed to time themselves to track their productivity, each activity will be split up into quarters by default (with 1 minute breaks in-between) but is customisable by the user.

The rewards will be simple enough where it doesn’t take too much away from their productivity, yet enticing enough that’ll keep users motivated to keep using the tracker as a way to maintain their goals.

The app will also provide collaboration, where users can study, learn, exercise or perform any other activity they want with other people.
